Designer Babies-Application of Genetic Engineering

Preimplantation genetic screening is one of the interesting biomedical advances that the world has seen in recent years and has undoubtedly been of the greatest social repercussion. However, escalating advancement of technology before and after the turn of the twenty first century makes designer babies not only science fiction but a real possibility. With recent development in world of genetics, the possibilities for reproductive uses are surging. Prenatal testing and screening have become regular action part of pregnancy for most women. Couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) may now have their embryos tested for genetic defects by preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The notion of the phenomenon designer babies are of the distant future, which is the alarming naivety that is going to permit this technologyâ€™s transformative powers. Gene therapy is slowly the possibility of treating genetic and other diseases and may one day allow us to enhance or eliminate completely desirable and undesirable traits, respectively. CRISPR technology, the one which was discovered only by chance in microbes is no getting applied on mammalian genes and is drastically speeding up the pace of genetic experimentation and could possibly eliminate many hereditary diseases from bloodlines
